        <h1>Web Development Proposal</h1>

        <p>
            While running your eCommerce website on a locked-down service like Shopify or Squarespace has its benefits, at a certain point in your business's growth, the freedom to add custom features essential to your business requires a self-hosted platform like WordPress. The flexibility and ecosystem of WordPress is second to none, giving you infinite possibilities for creating your brand and increasing sales. The solid feature set of the WooCommerce plugin gives you a great base to expand your online store from.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's go over how I will bring your 3 ecommerce websites (Kava Culture, Botanical Brewing Co., & Plant Tribals) to the self-hosted WordPress platform. This document will cover how long the process will take, and the cost involved, and also set the scope and expectations for this project.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since there are multiple sites in this proposal, I will first cover the process that all 3 share, then show where they differ in each site's own section.
        </p>

        <h2>What I'll do for each site</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                I'll set up a blank WordPress site on <a href="https://www.siteground.com/">SiteGround</a>, an excellent web host with great reliability and support. Their tools will make it easy to hand the site off to you if you end up choosing to maintain the site internally.
            </li>

            <li>
                I'll install <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a>, the top eCommerce plugin for WordPress. Then configure your site to make sure it's as discoverable as possible for search engines like Google.
            </li>

            <li>
                In order to complete some custom functionality in a time and cost effective manner, I might use a few premium plugins. These will be purchased with your own account, so you can safely add your payment details for the initial purchase and annual renewal for continued updates.
            </li>

            <li>
                The next thing to do is to integrate your store with either <a href="https://www.shipworks.com/">ShipWorks</a> or <a href="https://www.shipstation.com/">ShipStation</a>, so that any orders created on any of the stores get sent to a shipping service.
            </li>

            <li>
                I can transfer any existing data over to the new site at no additional charge. This can include products, orders, and customers.
            </li>

            <li>
                I'll create a custom theme that looks identical to the original site. The theme will be responsive and performant for mobile devices.
            </li>

            <li>
                Last, I'll set up a payment gateway for your store, and set your site up with an SMTP service. This improves email deliverability, making sure your store's emails end up in your customers' inboxes instead of the spam folder (or not delivering at all).
            </li>

            <li>
                After the site is finished, I can manage your site for $150/month. I'll apply updates to the WordPress installation and any plugins in a safe manner, making sure that any issues from these updates never reach your customer. This also covers the cost of keeping the website up and running. Otherwise, I can easily transfer ownership of the site to you.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Each site's development is broken up into major milestones. Each milestone will be easy for you to verify that everything you requested is present and acceptable. If something isn't right, you have 2 revisions available to make changes. Any further changes will be done at an additional hourly rate.
        </p>

        <!-- Site 1 -->
        <h2>Site 1 - Kava Culture</h2>

        </figure>

        <p>
            I will create a form for potential franchisees to sign up. This will send out an email to the franchise sales person so they can contact the potential franchisee.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, I will create a feature that allows you to create promotional events for each location. They will show up on each location's page.
        </p>

        <h3>Milestones</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                You can now add promotional events to your site through the WordPress dashboard. These promotional events have certain information associated with them and display on relevant location pages.
            </li>

            <li>
                (optional) All important existing data from the original site is now on the new site. This might include products, orders, customers, location information, and promotional events.
            </li>

            <li>
                Your site now looks identical to the original on the front end.
            </li>

            <li>
                New orders are sent to a shipping solution, such as ShipWorks or ShipStation.
            </li>

            <li>
                Your site is now set up and ready for payment transactions.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            I'll add wholesale functionality to your store, restricting access to products to customers with registered accounts. Accounts belong to customer groups, which get different discounts. There will be a form on the site that allows customers to register as a wholesaler. The request will show up on the back end dashboard, where you can approve or deny the request.
