                <h2>Who am I?</h2>

                <p>
                    I’m a friendly web developer in Southwest Florida that loves to make beautiful, responsive, and usable sites and apps.

                <h2>What I Do Differently</h2>

                <h3>Focus on Quality</h3>

                <p>
                    I care about giving you the best results I can. I’ll do my best to follow best practices and deliver a site we can both be proud of.
                </p>

                <h3>Mobile First</h3>

                <p>
                    Half of web traffic is from mobile devices these days. Yet so many sites are half-baked on small screens, leaving a bad impression. I’ll make sure that your site is beautiful and usable on any screen size.
                </p>

                <h3>Custom Solutions</h3>

                <p>
                    One size does not fit all. I can code you a solution that is tailored to your exact needs, so you don’t have to rely on out-of-the-box features that don’t quite do the job, or bloated themes and plugins that ruin your site’s performance and security.

                <h2>Technologies</h2>

                <p>
                    I’m always learning and trying new things. I love solutions that start with modern built-in features of HTML and CSS that get enhanced with JavaScript. My go-to technologies for creating neat apps are Vue JS, Tailwind CSS, and Laravel. I use WordPress a lot at my job to create sites that I enhance with custom PHP code.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Python is the programming language I have the most fun with, and I’ve had a blast using it to automate some otherwise time-intensive and extremely boring tasks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can find some of my example work on my <a href="https://github.com/brandoncbang">GitHub</a> account.
