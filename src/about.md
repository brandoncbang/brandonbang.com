I've been building software for over a decade, since my dad got me my first programming book as a teenager. In high 
school, I would make simple websites and games with my friends. These days, I use my skills to solve real world 
problems, mostly with Laravel, Vue.js, and Tailwind CSS, but I've used many other programming languages and 
frameworks as well.

Some of my favorite projects I've worked on:

- An app that allows static sites to receive form submissions
- A physics/chemistry simulation game that runs in the browser
- A local-first calorie tracking app

You can see many of my other projects on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/brandoncbang). I'm a avid fan of Free 
and Open Source Software (FOSS), and I try to build publicly as much as possible.

When I'm not working with code, I'm usually practicing photography or drawing, going for long walks outdoors, and 
cooking for friends and family.
