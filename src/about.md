I've been building software for over 10 years, since my dad got me my first programming book as a teenager. In high 
school, I would make simple websites and games with my friends. These days, I use my skills to solve real world 
problems, mostly with Laravel, Vue.js, and Tailwind CSS, but I've used many other programming languages and 
frameworks as well.

Some interesting side projects I've worked on:

- A physics/chemistry simulation game that runs in the browser
- An app that allows static sites to receive form submissions
- A local-first calorie tracking app

When I'm not working with code, I'm usually practicing photography or drawing, going for long walks outdoors, and 
cooking for friends and family.
